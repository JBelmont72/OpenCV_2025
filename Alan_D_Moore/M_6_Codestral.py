''' Codestral gave great explanations, deepseek gave error handling plus good code
1 created the textedit widget where rich text is entered.
2.created the button widget
3.Added the two above to 'layout' LINE # 36
layout = qtw.QVBoxLayout()   #creates a vertical layout for the main window's central area
        layout.addWidget(self.textedit) ## adds QTextEdit widget to the layout as it is the main content area we want user interact with and manipulate text etc.
        layout.addWidget(myButton)
4.  central_widget = qtw.QWidget()   Line# 40  ## creates an empty QWidget container object which serves as a common parent for 
        all widgets/layouts added inside it (central area of main window).
    central_widget.setLayout(layout)  # Sets the layout you created earlier to be used by this central widget object.
    
5.   self.setCentralWidget(central_widget)   Line $ 42 ## sets your customized QWidget as a main/centeral widget within your QMainWindow class instance (self). This allows it to occupy entire area available for displaying other child widgets added inside of it earlier during construction phase.
Then made menuBar,  file_menu (open, save) use the menubar.addMenu('File')  then menubar.addAction('Open')...('Save')

( this is helpful on a MAC OS:     menuBar.setNativeMenuBar(False)  # Disables native menubar since we're using a cross-platform toolkit (PyQt5). By disabling this feature, our customized GUI window will have consistent appearance across different operating systems and desktop environments without any unexpected behavior or issues related to underlying system specific implementation details.)

the edit_toolbar = self.addToolBar('Edit') ## QToolBar  then has actions on textedit gui. to copy,clear,save etc
self.statusBar().showMessage('Welcome to my editor',2000)  is a nice touch. the second arguement is time shown
The menuBar,FileBar and Status Bar are all outside the centralwidget

The provided code is a basic text editor GUI built using PyQt5, which is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed:

Undefined textedit attribute error: In the initial layout setup, you're trying to add self.textedit widget before it is created which results in an AttributeError. To fix this issue, create and initialize the QTextEdit instance (named self.textedit) first within your constructor before adding it to any other widgets or layouts.
Incorrect use of setCentralWidget(): Currently, you're setting myButton as a central widget which is incorrect since you want a text editor with additional functionalities and not just an interactive button alone. To fix this issue, ensure that your QTextEdit instance (self.textedit) becomes the main widget and remove any subsequent calls to setCentralWidget().
Missing text insertion in open_file(): When a file is opened using the 'Open' menu action, you read its content but forgot to display it within your self.textedit instance. Add a call to insertPlainText(text) method of self.textedit to make sure that the loaded data gets displayed correctly on screen.
Update statusBar() message: When loading a file and inserting text into the editor, you should also update your status bar with an appropriate message indicating which document is currently being edited (currently opened). Add self.statusBar().showMessage(f'Editing {filename}') at the end of open_file() method for this purpose.
Code indentation issues: Proper indentation in Python plays a crucial role, especially when it comes to functions or loops within classes etc. Make sure that your code is properly indented and there are no spacing errors which might cause syntax problems later on during execution of the program. Here's how you can fix these issues with modifications made:
