Python zip() with enumerate

The combination of zip() and enumerate() is useful in scenarios where you want to process multiple lists or tuples in parallel, 
and also need to access their indices for any specific purpose.
'''

print('')
'''
Python zip() with Multiple Iterables

Pythonâ€™s zip() function can also be used to combine more than two iterables. It can take multiple iterables as input and return an iterable of tuples, 
where each tuple contains elements from the corresponding positions of the input iterables.

'''n the above code there are two one-dimensional numpy arrays 'x' and 'y' with three elements each. By applying np.hstack((x,y)), we get a new one-dimensional numpy array that has all the elements of x and y stacked horizontally. The resulting numpy array has six elements in total.
np.hstack() is useful when we want to combine multiple numpy arrays horizontally. It can be used to concatenate multiple numpy arrays with the same number of rows, but different number of columns, into a single numpy array.

[[ 3  5]
 [ 5  7]
 [ 7  9]
 The above code uses the numpy.hstack() function to horizontally stack two numpy arrays. The first array x is a column vector of shape (3,1) and the second array y is also a column vector of the same shape.
The numpy.hstack() function stacks the two arrays horizontally to produce a new 2-dimensional array of shape (3,2) where the elements of the first array appear in the first column and the elements of the second array appear in the second column.
The resulting array contains the elements [3, 5] in the first row, [5, 7] in the second row, and [7, 9] in the third row.
