os.walk it lists where it is( the root) 1st time will be imageDir, then all the folders in the directory and then all the folders inside the first foleder and the folders within each folder within each folder until it gets down to the files in each folder.
We want to return the 'root' (or path to the the folder/directory we want to start at)
Returns Root directory, directories(or Folders), and all the files
